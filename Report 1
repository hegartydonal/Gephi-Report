>To start, I was first of all happy with the way the finished graph image turned out and also with the way it clearly >portrayed my different networks or communities of friends on Facebook in a way that made much sense to me. 
>To determine the different levels of bonding between the nodes that were firstly presented to me in a vague square like >pattern, I firstly chose the expansion type layout, as it visually spread the betweeness my communities of friends from each >other until I stopped it at an extent I was happy with. I was able to determine the communities by the sheer closeness of >the clusters of nodes to each other and there were about six main such communities on my graph. I then proceeded to zoom in >on the image until as many of the nodes as possible that were not connected to any other had left the page, hence showing >all my connected nodes which is what really mattered most. I also found out the types of communities these were and to which >my different friends belonged to by labelling the nodes and therefore showing me different friends that I had made at >different times through the years such as in Irish College, France, Secondary School etc. It was also interesting how it >showed how the different nodes were linked by edges, telling me which of my friends knew others. Some of the nodes in >certain communities were also slightly edging towards sides of other communities as the influence here was based purely on >the mutual friends that these nodes had between them. But to make the final image look more clear, I unclicked the label >button to just show the bare nodes with the more visible connections or edges. To make these communities more visible for us>, I then had to partition them, by clicking partitioning then modularity class and then apply, which essentially colour >coded the different communities of nodes to help better distinguish one from the others. Now to find out the friends who >know the most friends or have the most connections, I changed the degree settings of the nodes with the least amount of >connections to be minimum size 10 and the nodes which were most connected to be maximum size 20, straight after doing this I >could see the larger nodes in the centre of the communities they belonged to and the weaker nodes more so on the periphery. >Also to make the graph a little more simplified I erased the friends or nodes on the periphery of my graph with little or no >connections or edges, so in order to make that happen I had to go to Windows, Filters, Topology, Degree Range and then >adjusted the degree range until it allowed me to display each node which had at least three connections or edges, hence >cutting the other nodes off the graph, and then I hit Filter. 
>There are a few concepts which help describe the shape of this graph also, the Betweeness Centrality is where you count the >shortest paths between individual nodes in a network. The Closeness Centrality shows the average social distance from each >individual to every other individual in the network. The Eigen-Vector Centrality is a concept which basically shows how well >connected a node is to other nodes with strong connections, all of which could be seen when assessing each community and >their ties amongst each other individually.
>This was more or less the image I was happy with when it came to this stage so I was ready to export my image, to do this I >clicked Preview and then hit Refresh and there it was on the preview page with the edges curved, I wasnâ€™t content with the >curved edges displaying the connections so I unclicked the curved edges option on the list on the side of the page. Finally, >to export the image I went to File, then I exported it in the form of a PDF File.
